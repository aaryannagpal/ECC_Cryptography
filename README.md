# ECC_Cryptography

My attempt at making an elliptical curve cryptographic system and establishing an ECDH key exchange system.

_These files are just for understanding the process behind the encryptions, and do not represent real-life case._

**Please do not use for real-life applications for the sake of security.**

## Usage
The _.py_ files are to be used for using the code properly as modules, while the _.ipynb_ can be used for the referencing and understanding the code and protocols.


Hoping to modify the code for real-world applications soon.
